Description: Borealis is an R library performing outlier analysis for
    count-based bisulfite sequencing data. It detectes outlier
    methylated CpG sites from bisulfite sequencing
    (BS-seq). The core of Borealis is modeling Beta-Binomial distributions. This
    can be useful for rare disease diagnoses.
